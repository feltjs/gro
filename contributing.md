hey! thanks for your interest in contributing! Welcome, but it's complicated!;;;;

So, this is just a project I work on to support my other work.
Although Gro is a [@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop) project,
I am its only developer for now,
and we have more important projects that occupy almost all of our time.

I don't want to spend much time on support outside of our needs.
But I do want to give away the source code in case it can help!
(and be improved? I'm not selfish for me, I'm selfish for the code, you see)
The license is MIT, so you're free to use and repurpose it without our permission.
We have so much work to do and Gro is just a low level tool.
You must understand, because you're reading a `contributing.md` document
for open source software, so I can only imagine that you value your own time.
Or .. you're a tourist I guess? Hi tourists!ðŸŒ„

Example: Gro doesn't support Windows. That's bad.
It excludes many people out there who don't know what a WSL is.
But I have too many things to prioritize,
and I feel it's irresponsible to push open source Node projects that don't support Windows.

So Gro sits in a pre-alpha limbo. For other reasons too -
things may change dramatically and I don't want the friction of breaking external users.
I value your time too!!

In summary, this free software is
[free as in puppy](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/1371159136684105728),
I guess is what I'm saying.
I hope it's not free as in mattress... that's not the software I want to dump on the world.

I'm definitely interested in **discussing** Gro.
Open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)!

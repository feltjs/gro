hey! thanks for your interest in contributing! Welcome, but it's complicated!;;;;

So, Gro is a project that I, a developer of quantity 1, use to support my other work.
Although Gro is a [@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop) project,
I am its only developer for now,
and we have [more important projects](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt)
that occupy almost all of our time.
For more you can read about [Gro's current philosophy](src/docs/philosophy.md).

I don't want to spend much time on support outside of our needs.
Some is fine, welcome even 😺 but there is a line 😾 and I don't know where it is yet.
And I want to give away the source code because I think it's useful and cool.
The license is MIT, so you're free to use and repurpose it.
We have much work to do and Gro is just a low level tool.
time is precious🌄

Example: Gro doesn't support Windows. That's not great.
It excludes many people out there who don't know what a WSL is.
I have many other things to prioritize,
but I also don't want to promote open source Node projects that don't support Windows.

So Gro sits in a pre-alpha limbo. For other reasons too —
things may change dramatically and I don't want the friction of breaking external users this early.
I value your time too!! There probably won't be too much chaos-churn,
but some % of dev users will have stability expectations I can't meet yet.

All that said: **if you draw inside its lines, Gro is a good development tool today IMO**.
(I think its task runner alone is worth the dependency)
I am happy to take contributions in any form,
but **please open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)**
**before attempting work that you expect to be merged.**

Also, Gro can't work for everyone's needs and still be Gro.
I'm trying to make it flexible, and if it doesn't work for you,
I would enjoy discussing your issues,
along with any questions or pointers you may have
for improving the usefulness of the software gracefully.
Big caveat though, I also can't guarantee that Gro will work for your use cases,
and at times it's quite possible I may look, gasp, inflexible, myself.
This is why Gro's tagline is:

> opinionated tools for web development

It's trying to say "look out for the opinions: it's normal to disagree; MIT".
But Gro _is_ more general-purpose than the phrase may suggest.
But SvelteKit and Vite are _actually designed to be_ general-purpose tools.
Please set your expectations accordingly 🐢
I expect we'll see more kits/metaframeworks tailored to needs beyond Gro's scope.

> **fun fact**: not every design detail in Gro is an opinion! sometimes it's just an implementation 🐌

In summary, this free software is
[free as in puppy](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/1371159136684105728),
I guess is what I'm saying.
I hope it's not free as in mattress... that's not the software I want to dump on the world.

I'm always interested in discussing Gro —
open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)!

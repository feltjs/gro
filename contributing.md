hey! thanks for your interest in contributing! Welcome, but it's complicated!;;;;

So, this is just a project I work on to support my other work.
Although Gro is a [@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop) project,
I am its sole developer for now,
and we have more important projects that occupy almost all of our time.

I don't want to spend much time on support outside of our needs.
But I do want to give away the source code in case it can help! (and be improved?)
We have so much work to do and Gro is just a low level tool.
I know for sure you understand, because you're reading a `contributing.md` document
for open source software, so I can only imagine that you value your own time.
Or .. you're a tourist I guess? Hi tourists!ðŸŒ„

Example: Gro doesn't support Windows. That's bad.
It excludes many people out there who don't know what a WSL is.
But I have too many things to prioritize,
and I feel it's irresponsible to push open source Node projects that don't support Windows.

So Gro sits in a pre-alpha limbo. For other reasons too -
things may change dramatically and I don't want the friction of breaking external users.
I value your time too!!

In summary, this free software is free as in puppy, I guess is what I'm saying.
I hope it's not free as in mattress... that's not the software I want to dump on the world.
The [readme](./README.md) has more info on this.

I'm definitely interested in **discussing** Gro.
Open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)!

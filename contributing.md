hey! thanks for your interest in contributing! Welcome, but it's complicated!;;;;

So, Gro is a project that I, a developer of quantity 1, use to support my other work.
Although Gro is a [@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop) project,
I am its only developer for now,
and we have more important projects that occupy almost all of our time.

I don't want to spend much time on support outside of our needs.
Some is fine ‚Äî welcome even! ‚Äî but there's a line I don't know yet.
And I want to give away the source code because I think it's useful and cool.
(and be improved? I'm not selfish for me, I'm selfish for the code, you see)
The license is MIT, so you're free to use and repurpose it without our permission.
We have much work to do and Gro is just a low level tool.
time is preciousüåÑ

Example: Gro doesn't support Windows. That's not great.
It excludes many people out there who don't know what a WSL is.
I have many other things to prioritize,
but I also don't want to promote open source Node projects that don't support Windows.

So Gro sits in a pre-alpha limbo. For other reasons too ‚Äî
things may change dramatically and I don't want the friction of breaking external users this early.
I value your time too!!

All that said: **if you draw inside its lines, Gro is a good development tool today _IMO_**.
(I think its task runner alone is worth the dependency (TODO publish a slim `gro-cli`))
I am happy to take contributions in any form,
but please open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)
before attempting work that you expect to be merged.

Also, Gro can't work for everyone's needs and still be Gro.
I'm trying to make it flexible, and I welcome pointers
on improving the usefulness of the software gracefully,
but I also can't guarantee that Gro will work for your use cases.
This is why Gro's tagline is:

> opinionated tools for web development

It's trying to signal that, "look out for the opinions: it's normal to disagree; MIT".
But Gro _is_ more general-purpose than the phrase may suggest.
But SvelteKit and Vite are _actually designed to be_ general-purpose tools.
Please set your expectations accordingly üê¢
I expect we'll see more kits/metaframeworks tailored to needs beyond Gro's scope.

In summary, this free software is
[free as in puppy](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/1371159136684105728),
I guess is what I'm saying.
I hope it's not free as in mattress... that's not the software I want to dump on the world.

I'm always interested in discussing Gro ‚Äî open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)!

hey! thanks for your interest in contributing! Welcome, but it's complicated!;;;;

So, Gro is a project that I, a developer of quantity 1, use to support my other work.
Although Gro is a [@feltcoop](https://github.com/feltcoop) project,
I am its only developer for now,
and we have
[more](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt)
[important](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt-server)
[projects](https://github.com/feltcoop/felt.social)
that occupy almost all of our time.
For more you can read about [Gro's current philosophy](/src/docs/philosophy.md).

I'm wary of spending too much time on support outside of our needs.
Some is fine, welcome even 😺 but there is a line 😾 and I don't know where it is yet.
And I want to give away the source code because I think it's useful and cool.
The license is MIT, so you're free to use and repurpose it.
We have much work to do and Gro is just a low level tool.
time is precious 🌄
I'm slowly making progress toward getting Gro to be more usable for others,
but if you're into this sort of thing and unafraid of bad code and docs,
you are invited to scour Gro's markdown documents and see what you think.

Example: Gro doesn't support Windows. That's not great.
It excludes many people out there who don't know what a WSL is.
I have many other things to prioritize,
but I also don't want to promote open source Node projects that don't support Windows.

So Gro sits in a pre-alpha limbo. For other reasons too —
things may change dramatically and I don't want the friction of breaking external users this early.
I value your time too!! There may be more churn than some significant % of dev users can tolerate.

All that said: **if you draw inside its lines, Gro is a good development tool today IMO**.
(I think its task runner alone is worth the dependency)
I am happy to take contributions in any form,
but **please open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)**
**before attempting work that you _expect_ to be merged.**
If you're reasonably sure it's an straightforward improvement or don't mind being turned down,
I don't mind if you only send a PR and no issue.

Also, Gro can't work for everyone's needs and still be Gro.
I'm trying to make it flexible, and if it doesn't work for you,
I would enjoy discussing your issues and questions and merging PRs,
tho probably open an issue on big stuff.
Big caveat though, I also can't guarantee that Gro will work for your use cases,
and at times it's I may look inflexible. (it's ok to push back, but please be kind!)
This is why Gro's tagline is:

> opinionated tools for web development

It's trying to say "look out for the opinions: it's normal to disagree; MIT".
But Gro _is_ more general-purpose than the phrase may suggest.
But SvelteKit and Vite are _actually designed to be_ general-purpose tools.
Please set your expectations accordingly 🐢
I expect we'll see more and more kits tailored
to needs beyond Gro's already-opinionated scope.

> **fun fact**: not every design detail in Gro is an opinion! sometimes it's just an implementation 🐌

In summary, this free software is
[free as in puppy](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/1371159136684105728),
I guess is what I'm saying.
I hope it's not free as in mattress... that's not the software I want to dump on the world.

I'm always interested in discussing Gro —
open [issues](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/issues)!

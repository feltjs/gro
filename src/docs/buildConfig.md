# build config

Gro's build config is part of a system for compiling a source project
to one or more output artifacts.
It's designed for a variety of use cases:

- support dev and prod builds that coexist on the filesystem
- support multiple compilation targets like legacy/modern ES versions and mobile/desktop frontends
- support multiple platform targets like Node and browsers, including server-side rendering
- support multiple packages created from one codebase to be published separately

To accomplish this, Gro has the `BuildConfig` type
which defines some JSON metadata for each build.
See [`src/project/buildConfig.ts`](/src/project/buildConfig.ts) for the implementation.
A project can add this data to its `package.json` under a `"gro"` field.

Why put this in `package.json` and not a more powerful `gro.config.ts` file?
A Gro project's build configs must be statically knowable before compilation,
because there's a chicken and egg problem -
if a config is defined in TypeScript,
we need to compile it to execute and read it,
but to compile it we need the config - so we're stuck.
This can be solved in other ways,
like compiling to a temporary directory or using something like `ts-node`,
but these solutions introduce overhead and complexity we'd rather avoid right now.
This is subject to change, though -
it seems likely we'll want to define the entire Gro config in a runnable `gro.config.ts`.

So for now, Gro reads a single field from a project's `package.json`.
Here's what a Node project may look like:

```jsonc
{
	// some-node-project/package.json
	"gro": {
		"builds": [
			{
				"name": "node",
				"platform": "node"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

The `"platform"` can currently be `"node"` or `"browser"` and
is used by compilers for TypeScript and Svelte.
When compiling for Node, the Svelte compiler outputs SSR components instead of the normal DOM ones.

The `"name"` field can be anything and maps to the build's directory name.
By defining `"name": "node",`, running `gro compile` or `gro build` creates builds
in `.gro/dev/node/` and `.gro/prod/node/`, respectively.

Here's what a frontend-only project may look like.
It's also the fallback default for projects that do not define anything:

```jsonc
{
	// some-frontend-project/package.json
	"gro": {
		"builds": [
			{
				"name": "browser",
				"platform": "browser"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Here's an example for a project that creates both server and client builds
with a second client optimized for mobile browsers:

```jsonc
{
	// some-fullstack-project/package.json
	"gro": {
		"builds": [
			{
				"name": "node",
				"platform": "node"
			},
			{
				"name": "browser_desktop",
				"platform": "browser"
			},
			{
				"name": "browser_mobile",
				"platform": "browser"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

## additional options

The build config has some options. Here's the [`BuildConfig`](/src/project/buildConfig.ts) type:

```ts
export interface BuildConfig {
	readonly name: string;
	readonly platform: PlatformTarget;
	readonly dist?: boolean;
	readonly primary?: boolean;
}
```

The optional `dist` flag marks builds for inclusion in the root `dist/` directory
by [the `gro dist` task](/src/dist.task.ts).
If no `dist` flag is found on any builds, all builds are included.
If multiple builds are found, the `gro dist` task copies their directories into `dist/`,
named according to the `"name"` build config field.
If one build is found, its contents are put directly into `dist/` with no directory namespacing.
Like all builtin tasks, you can easily customize this behavior
by creating `src/dist.task.ts` in your project and optionally
[invoking the original task](/src/task#run-a-task-inside-another-task).

The optional `primary` flag tells Gro which build should be used
for running tasks, tests, code generation, and other Node-related development concerns.
If no `primary` flag exists on any build, Gro infers the primary build,
looking for the first where `platform` is `'node'`,
and if none is found, it chooses the first build in the array.

## todo

- As designed, the build system does not account for the fact
  that Gro projects often have tasks and other modules designed to run in Node,
  but mixed in with whatever source code is in `src/`.
  This is a conceptual mismatch for projects that have only browser builds.
  So far this hasn't been an issue - frontend code avoids importing these modules
  and the build system, despite targeting the browser, doesn't break the Node modules,
  but we'd like to figure out an ergonomic design that addresses this complexity.
  There's a similar problem with tests - currently only the primary build's tests are executed.
- Use JSONSchema validation for the config to give users good error messages.

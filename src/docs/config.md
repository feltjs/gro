# config

Gro's config is part of a system for compiling a source project
to one or more output artifacts.
It's designed for a variety of use cases:

- support dev and prod builds that coexist on the filesystem
- support multiple compilation targets like legacy/modern ES versions and mobile/desktop frontends
- support multiple platform targets like Node and browsers, including server-side rendering
- support multiple packages created from one codebase to be published separately

To accomplish this, Gro has an optional config file that lives at `$PROJECT/src/gro.config.ts`.
If a project does not define a config, Gro imports a default config from
[`src/config/gro.config.default.ts`](/src/config/gro.config.default.ts).

See [`src/config/config.ts`](/src/config/config.ts) for the config implementation.

## build config

The `builds` property of the Gro config
is an array of build configs that describe a project's outputs.
Here's the [`PartialBuildConfig`](/src/config/buildConfig.ts) type:

```ts
export interface PartialBuildConfig {
	readonly name: string;
	readonly platform: PlatformTarget; // 'node' | 'browser'
	readonly dist?: boolean;
	readonly primary?: boolean;
	readonly include?: null | ((id: string) => boolean);
}
```

The `platform` can currently be `"node"` or `"browser"` and
is used by compilers for TypeScript and Svelte.
When compiling for Node, the Svelte compiler outputs SSR components instead of the normal DOM ones.

The `name` field can be anything and maps to the build's directory name.
By defining `"name": "node",`, running `gro compile`, `gro dev`, or `gro build` creates builds
in `.gro/dev/node/` and `.gro/prod/node/`, respectively.

Importantly, **Gro always includes a hardcoded Node build named `"node"`**
that it uses to compile your project and run things like tests, tasks, and codegen.
Ideally this would be configurable, but doing so would slow Gro down in many cases.

The optional `dist` flag marks builds for inclusion in the root `dist/` directory
by [the `gro dist` task](/src/dist.task.ts).
If no `dist` flag is found on any builds, all builds are included.
If multiple builds are found, the `gro dist` task copies their directories into `dist/`,
named according to the `name` build config field.
If one build is found, its contents are put directly into `dist/` with no directory namespacing.
Like all builtin tasks, you can easily customize this behavior
by creating `src/dist.task.ts` in your project and optionally
[invoking the original task](/src/task#run-a-task-inside-another-task).

The optional `primary` flag tells Gro which build of each platform
should be used when doing something that needs exactly one build.
For Node builds, this includes things like running tasks, tests, codegen,
and other Node-related development concerns.
For browser builds, this is the build that's served by the development server.
As mentioned above, the `primary` Node build is always named `"node"`.
For other platforms, if no `primary` flag exists on any build,
Gro marks the first build in the `builds` array as primary.

The optional `include` property can be used to include or exclude a particular file.
It's convenient to use the `createFilter` helper from `@rollup/pluginutils` here.

## examples

Here's a config for a simple Node project:

```ts
import {GroConfigCreator} from '@feltcoop/gro/dist/config/config.js';

const createConfig: GroConfigCreator = async () => {
	return {
		builds: [{name: 'node', platform: 'node'}],
	};
};

export default createConfig;
```

Here's what a frontend-only project with both desktop and mobile builds may look like:

```ts
import {GroConfigCreator} from '@feltcoop/gro/dist/config/config.js';

const createConfig: GroConfigCreator = async () => {
	return {
		builds: [
			{name: 'browser_mobile', platform: 'browser', dist: true},
			{name: 'browser_desktop', platform: 'browser', dist: true, primary: true},
			// {name: 'node', platform: 'node'}, // this is implicit to run tasks, tests, codegen, etc
		],
	};
};

export default createConfig;
```

/*

This is a higher order function that tracks obtained references to a thing
and calls `release` when all obtainers have released their references.

It allows decoupled consumers to use things with a lifecycle
without disrupting each other when they're done with the thing.

The motivating use case was reusing a database connection across multiple tasks.

See the tests for usage examples - ./createObtainable.test.ts

## motivation

The `gro gen` task allows us to enhance our projects
with convention-based code generation (codegen) techniques.

Why? Codegen can produce game-changing results for UX and DX,
especially around performance, flexibility, consistency, and development speed.
As developers, automating our work is a natural and indispensable power,
and `gro gen` brings automation deeper into our code authoring workflows.

By convention, `gro gen` looks through `src/`
for any TypeScript files with `.gen.` in the file name,
and it outputs a file stripped of `.gen.` to the same directory.
The `*.gen.*` origin files export a `gen` function
that returns the contents of the output file.
More flexibility is available when needed
including custom file names, custom output directories,
and multiple output files.

Normally you'll want to commit generated files to git,
but you can always gitignore a specific pattern like `*.ignore.*`
and name the output files accordingly.
We may want to smooth out this use case in the future.

Integrating codegen into our development process
is a simple idea with vast potential.
It allows us to have a single source of truth for data
that would otherwise be scattered throughout our codebases
without compromising any of our code's runtime characteristics.
We can generate documentation, types, validators, tests,
and more by introspecting our data at buildtime,
which speeds up development
and helps us write code that's easier to understand and change.
The goal is to leverage automation to increase the power we wield over our code
with a straightforward developer experience.
Ergonomics are key to unlocking codegen's full potential.

**Be aware** â€” this is a sharp tool!
It adds a layer of indirection between the code you write and run.
Also, you could introduce security vulnerabilities
if you fail to escape certain inputs.
Importantly, there is no support for source maps right now.
Source maps could be added at some point, at least in many cases.

Inspirations include Lisp macros and
[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte), a compiler for building UIs.
Svelte is the UI library integrated in
the parent project [Gro](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro).

## usage

The `gro gen` task looks for any files with `.gen.`
in the file name and tries to call an exported `gen`
function to generate one or more output files.

```bash
gro gen # runs codegen for all *.gen.* files in src/
```

> in the following examples,
> note that importing the `Gen` type is optional,
> but it makes for a better DX

### generate TypeScript

Given `src/script.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const message = 'generated!';
	return `console.log('${message}')`;
};
```

Outputs `src/script.ts`:

```ts
console.log('generated!');
```

### generate other filetypes

Files with any extension can be generated without configuration.
If the origin file name ends with the pattern `.gen.*.ts`,
the default output file name is stripped of its trailing `.ts`.
Given `src/markup.gen.html.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const body = 'hi';
	return `
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				${body}
			</body>
		</html>
	`;
};
```

Outputs `src/markup.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		hi
	</body>
</html>
```

### generate a custom file name or write to a different directory

The `gen` function can return an object with custom configuration.
Given `src/somewhere/originalName.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const message = 'output path can be relative and name can be anything';
	return {
		contents: `console.log('${message}')`,
		fileName: '../elsewhere/otherName.ts',
	};
};
```

Outputs `src/elsewhere/otherName.ts`:

```ts
console.log('output path can be relative and name can be anything');
```

### generate multiple custom files

The `gen` function can also return an array of files.
Given `src/thing.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const fieldValue = 1;
	return [
		{
			contents: `
				import {Thing} from './types';
				export const isThing = (t: any): t is Thing => t?.field === ${fieldValue};
			`,
		},
		{
			contents: `export interface Thing { field: ${typeof fieldValue} }`,
			fileName: 'types.ts',
		},
		{
			contents: `{"field": ${fieldValue}}`,
			fileName: 'data/thing.json',
		},
	];
};
```

Outputs `src/thing.ts`:

```ts
import {Thing} from './types.js';
export const isThing = (t: any): t is Thing => t?.field === 1;
```

and `src/types.ts`:

```ts
export interface Thing {
	field: number;
}
```

and `src/data/thing.json`:

```json
{
	"field": 1
}
```

### check that generated files have not changed

It's often helpful to check if any generated files are new or have changed.
We don't want to forget to regenerate files before committing or publishing!
The `check` CLI argument can be passed to perform this check
instead of writing the generated files to disk.

```bash
gro gen --check # exits with error code 1 if anything is new or different
```

or in code:

```ts
import {Task} from '@feltcoop/gro';
import {task as genTask} from '@feltcoop/gro/dist/gen.task.js';

export const task: Task = {
	run: async (ctx) => {
		// this throws a `TaskError` if anything is new or different
		await genTask.run({...ctx, args: {...ctx.args, check: true}});
	},
};
```

Gro uses this in [`check.task.ts`](../check.task.ts)
which is called in the npm [`"preversion"`](../../package.json) script.

## about

Gro is an opinionated monotool for making webapps.
It includes:

- [task runner](src/task) that uses the filesystem convention `*.task.ts`
  (docs at [`src/task`](src/task))
- testing library called `oki` (docs at [`src/oki`](src/oki))
- codegen by convention called `gen` (docs at [`src/gen`](src/gen))
- dev server
- integrated UI development with
  [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)
- fully integrated [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript)
- bundling via [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- formatting via [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- more to come, exploring what deeply integrated tools enable
  in the realms of developer power and ergonomics and end user experience

## usage

```bash
gro # lists all available tasks with the pattern `*.task.ts`
gro some/dir # lists all tasks inside `src/some/dir`
gro some/file # runs `src/some/file.task.ts`
gro some/file.task.ts # same as above
gro test # run one of Gro's tasks or `src/test.task.ts` if it exists
```

Gro has a number of builtin tasks.
To learn more [see the task docs](src/task)
and [the generated task index](src/docs/tasks.md).

```bash
gro dev # builds in watch mode and starts a dev server
```

```bash
gro build # build once, defaulting to NODE_ENV=development
```

Testing with `oki` (docs at [`src/oki`](src/oki))

```bash
gro test # run all tests for `*.test.ts` files
```

Codegen with `gen` (docs at [`src/gen`](src/gen))

```bash
gro gen # runs codegen for all `*.gen.*` files
gro gen --check # errors if any generated files are new or different
```

```bash
gro format # formats all of the source files using Prettier
gro format --check # checks that all source files are formatted
```

```bash
gro serve # staticly serves the current directory (or a configured one)
```

```bash
gro check # typechecks, runs tests, and ensures generated files are current
gro typecheck # just the typechecking
```

## develop

```bash
npm run bootstrap # builds and links `gro` - needed only once
gro test # make sure everything looks good - same as `npm test`

# development
gro project/dev # build in watch mode
gro project/dist # update the `gro` CLI

# release
gro project/build # builds for release and updates the `gro` CLI
```
